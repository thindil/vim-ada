K.2 Language-Defined Attributes


1/3 This subclause summarizes the definitions given elsewhere of the
language-defined attributes. Attributes are properties of entities that can be
queried by an Ada program.

2   P'Access    For a prefix P that denotes a subprogram:

3               P'Access yields an access value that designates the subprogram
                denoted by P. The type of P'Access is an access-to-subprogram
                type (S), as determined by the expected type. See 3.10.2.

4   X'Access    For a prefix X that denotes an aliased view of an object:

5               X'Access yields an access value that designates the object
                denoted by X. The type of X'Access is an access-to-object
                type, as determined by the expected type. The expected type
                shall be a general access type. See 3.10.2.

6/1 X'Address   For a prefix X that denotes an object, program unit, or label:

7               Denotes the address of the first of the storage elements
                allocated to X. For a program unit or label, this value refers
                to the machine code associated with the corresponding body or
                statement. The value of this attribute is of type
                System.Address. See 13.3.

8   S'Adjacent  For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

9               S'Adjacent denotes a function with the following
                specification:

10                  function S'Adjacent (X, Towards : T)
                      return T

11              If Towards = X, the function yields X; otherwise, it yields
                the machine number of the type T adjacent to X in the
                direction of Towards, if that machine number exists. If the
                result would be outside the base range of S, Constraint_Error
                is raised. When T'Signed_Zeros is True, a zero result has the
                sign of X. When Towards is zero, its sign has no bearing on
                the result. See A.5.3.

12  S'Aft       For every fixed point subtype S:

13              S'Aft yields the number of decimal digits needed after the
                decimal point to accommodate the delta of the subtype S,
                unless the delta of the subtype S is greater than 0.1, in
                which case the attribute yields the value one. (S'Aft is the
                smallest positive integer N for which (10**N)*S'Delta is
                greater than or equal to one.) The value of this attribute is
                of the type universal_integer. See 3.5.10.

13.1/2 S'Alignment
                For every subtype S:

13.2/2          The value of this attribute is of type universal_integer, and
                nonnegative.

13.3/2          For an object X of subtype S, if S'Alignment is not zero, then
                X'Alignment is a nonzero integral multiple of S'Alignment
                unless specified otherwise by a representation item. See
                13.3.

14/1 X'Alignment
                For a prefix X that denotes an object:

15/2            The value of this attribute is of type universal_integer, and
                nonnegative; zero means that the object is not necessarily
                aligned on a storage element boundary. If X'Alignment is not
                zero, then X is aligned on a storage unit boundary and
                X'Address is an integral multiple of X'Alignment (that is, the
                Address modulo the Alignment is zero).

16/2            This paragraph was deleted. See 13.3.

17  S'Base      For every scalar subtype S:

18              S'Base denotes an unconstrained subtype of the type of S. This
                unconstrained subtype is called the base subtype of the type.
                See 3.5.

19  S'Bit_Order For every specific record subtype S:

20              Denotes the bit ordering for the type of S. The value of this
                attribute is of type System.Bit_Order. See 13.5.3.

21/1 P'Body_Version
                For a prefix P that statically denotes a program unit:

22              Yields a value of the predefined type String that identifies
                the version of the compilation unit that contains the body
                (but not any subunits) of the program unit. See E.3.

23  T'Callable  For a prefix T that is of a task type (after any implicit
                dereference):

24              Yields the value True when the task denoted by T is callable,
                and False otherwise; See 9.9.

25  E'Caller    For a prefix E that denotes an entry_declaration:

26/3            Yields a value of the type Task_Id that identifies the task
                whose call is now being serviced. Use of this attribute is
                allowed only inside an accept_statement, or entry_body after
                the entry_barrier, corresponding to the entry_declaration
                denoted by E. See C.7.1.

27  S'Ceiling   For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

28              S'Ceiling denotes a function with the following specification:

29                  function S'Ceiling (X : T)
                      return T

30              The function yields the value Ceiling(X), i.e., the smallest
                (most negative) integral value greater than or equal to X.
                When X is zero, the result has the sign of X; a zero result
                otherwise has a negative sign when S'Signed_Zeros is True. See
                A.5.3.

31  S'Class     For every subtype S of a tagged type T (specific or
                class-wide):

32              S'Class denotes a subtype of the class-wide type (called
                T'Class in this International Standard) for the class rooted
                at T (or if S already denotes a class-wide subtype, then
                S'Class is the same as S).

33              S'Class is unconstrained. However, if S is constrained, then
                the values of S'Class are only those that when converted to
                the type T belong to S. See 3.9.

34  S'Class     For every subtype S of an untagged private type whose full
                view is tagged:

35              Denotes the class-wide subtype corresponding to the full view
                of S. This attribute is allowed only from the beginning of the
                private part in which the full view is declared, until the
                declaration of the full view. After the full view, the Class
                attribute of the full view can be used. See 7.3.1.

36/1 X'Component_Size
                For a prefix X that denotes an array subtype or array object
                (after any implicit dereference):

37              Denotes the size in bits of components of the type of X. The
                value of this attribute is of type universal_integer. See
                13.3.

38  S'Compose   For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

39              S'Compose denotes a function with the following specification:

40                  function S'Compose (Fraction : T;
                                        Exponent : universal_integer)
                      return T

41              Let v be the value Fraction  T'Machine_Radix(Exponent-k),
                where k is the normalized exponent of Fraction. If v is a
                machine number of the type T, or if |v| >= T'Model_Small, the

220             Let v be the value X  T'Machine_Radix(Adjustment). If v is a
                machine number of the type T, or if |v| >= T'Model_Small, the
                function yields v; otherwise, it yields either one of the
                machine numbers of the type T adjacent to v. Constraint_Error
                is optionally raised if v is outside the base range of S. A
                zero result has the sign of X when S'Signed_Zeros is True. See
                A.5.3.

221 S'Signed_Zeros
                For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

222             Yields the value True if the hardware representation for the
                type T has the capability of representing both positively and
                negatively signed zeros, these being generated and used by the
                predefined operations of the type T as specified in IEC
                559:1989; yields the value False otherwise. The value of this
                attribute is of the predefined type Boolean. See A.5.3.

224             If S is definite, denotes the size (in bits) that the
                implementation would choose for the following objects of
                subtype S:

225               * A record component of subtype S when the record type is
                    packed.

226               * The formal parameter of an instance of
                    Unchecked_Conversion that converts from subtype S to some
                    other subtype.

227             If S is indefinite, the meaning is implementation defined. The
                value of this attribute is of the type universal_integer. See
                13.3.

228/1 X'Size    For a prefix X that denotes an object:

229             Denotes the size in bits of the representation of the object.
                The value of this attribute is of the type universal_integer.
                See 13.3.

                For every access-to-object subtype S:

233             Denotes the storage pool of the type of S. The type of this
                attribute is Root_Storage_Pool'Class. See 13.11.

234 S'Storage_Size
                For every access-to-object subtype S:

235             Yields the result of calling Storage_Size(S'Storage_Pool),
                which is intended to be a measure of the number of storage
                elements reserved for the pool. The type of this attribute is
                universal_integer. See 13.11.

236/1 T'Storage_Size
                For a prefix T that denotes a task object (after any implicit
                dereference):

237             Denotes the number of storage elements reserved for the task.
                The value of this attribute is of the type universal_integer.
                The Storage_Size includes the size of the task's stack, if
                any. The language does not specify whether or not it includes
                other storage associated with the task (such as the "task
                control block" used by some implementations.) See 13.3.

                For every subtype S of an elementary type T:

237.2/3         Denotes the number of bits read from or written to a stream by
                the default implementations of S'Read and S'Write. Hence, the
                number of stream elements required per item of elementary type
                T is:

237.3/2             T'Stream_Size / Ada.Streams.Stream_Element'Size

237.4/2         The value of this attribute is of type universal_integer and
                is a multiple of Stream_Element'Size. See 13.13.2.

239             S'Succ denotes a function with the following specification:

240                 function S'Succ(Arg : S'Base)
                      return S'Base

241             For an enumeration type, the function returns the value whose
                position number is one more than that of the value of Arg;
                Constraint_Error is raised if there is no such value of the
                type. For an integer type, the function returns the result of
                adding one to the value of Arg. For a fixed point type, the
                function returns the result of adding small to the value of
                Arg. For a floating point type, the function returns the
                machine number (as defined in 3.5.7) immediately above the
                value of Arg; Constraint_Error is raised if there is no such
                machine number. See 3.5.

                implicit dereference):

245             X'Tag denotes the tag of X. The value of this attribute is of
                type Tag. See 3.9.

                dereference):

247             Yields the value True if the task denoted by T is terminated,
                and False otherwise. The value of this attribute is of the
                predefined type Boolean. See 9.9.

250                 function S'Truncation (X : T)
                      return T

251             The function yields the value Ceiling(X) when X is negative,
                and Floor(X) otherwise. A zero result has the sign of X when
                S'Signed_Zeros is True. See A.5.3.

252 S'Unbiased_Rounding
                For every subtype S of a floating point type T:

253             S'Unbiased_Rounding denotes a function with the following
                specification:

254                 function S'Unbiased_Rounding (X : T)
                      return T

255             The function yields the integral value nearest to X, rounding
                toward the even integer if X lies exactly halfway between two
                integers. A zero result has the sign of X when S'Signed_Zeros
                is True. See A.5.3.

                For a prefix X that denotes an aliased view of an object:

257             All rules and semantics that apply to X'Access (see 3.10.2)
                apply also to X'Unchecked_Access, except that, for the
                purposes of accessibility rules and checks, it is as if X were
                declared immediately within a library package. See 13.10.

258 S'Val       For every discrete subtype S:

259             S'Val denotes a function with the following specification:

260                 function S'Val(Arg : universal_integer)
                      return S'Base

261             This function returns a value of the type of S whose position
                number equals the value of Arg. See 3.5.5.

                implicit dereference):

263/4           Yields True if and only if the object denoted by X is normal,
                has a valid representation, and then, if the preceding
                conditions hold, the value of X also satisfies the predicates
                of the nominal subtype of X. The value of this attribute is of
                the predefined type Boolean. See 13.9.2.

                the version of the compilation unit that contains the
                declaration of the program unit. See E.3.
